Privacy Policy for NetFuel VPN
Effective Date: January 13, 2026
1. Introduction Welcome to NetFuel. Your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our free VPN service.
2. Zero-Logs Policy (VPN) We maintain a strict No-Logs Policy.
•
We do not collect or log your browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries.
•
We do not store your original IP address or the IP address of the VPN server you connect to. Your online activities are completely anonymous and private.
3. Data Usage & Limits NetFuel provides a free service with a daily limit (e.g., 5GB). To enforce these limits:
•
We track the amount of data (MB/GB) transferred during your active sessions.
•
This tracking is associated with a unique device identifier (Android ID) to ensure fair usage and reset limits every 24 hours.
4. Advertising (Google AdMob) To keep our VPN free, we use Google AdMob to show advertisements.
•
AdMob may collect and use anonymous data (such as advertising IDs) to show personalized ads.
•
You can manage your ad preferences in your Google Account settings.
5. Permissions
•
VPN Service: Our app requires the VPNService permission to create a secure, encrypted tunnel to our servers. Without this, the app cannot function.
•
Notifications: We use notifications to alert you when you reach data limits or need to watch ads to unlock more data.
6. Data Security We use industry-standard encryption protocols to protect your data while it is in transit through our VPN tunnel. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
7. Third-Party Links Our app may contain links to other sites (like Privacy Policies or Support). We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those third-party services.
8. Children's Privacy NetFuel does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover a child has provided us with personal info, we immediately delete it.
9. Changes to This Policy We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
